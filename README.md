# Welcome to My Code-Based CV

## Why Code Instead of a PDF?

You're probably here because you reached out with a job opportunity and asked for my CV. Here's the thing: I don't have a traditional PDF resume, and that's intentional.

Instead of a static document that tells you _about_ my skills, I'd rather show you through **code**. This repository is my living, breathing CV—a space where I can express my technical abilities, problem-solving approach, and coding philosophy in the most authentic way possible.

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't just a portfolio site—it's a demonstration of:

- **How I think** through problems
- **How I write** code
- **How I structure** projects
- **How I document** my work
- **How I approach** development challenges

Every commit, every component, every architectural decision tells a story about who I am as a developer.

## How to Explore

Feel free to:

- Browse the codebase to see my coding style
- Check out the commit history to understand my development process
- Read the [decision records](./decision-records/) to understand the reasoning behind key choices
- Run the project locally to experience what I've built
- Read the documentation to see how I communicate technical concepts

## The Philosophy

A PDF can list technologies and experiences, but code shows:

- **Attention to detail** in implementation
- **Code quality** and best practices
- **Architecture decisions** and trade-offs
- **Problem-solving** in real-time
- **Continuous learning** through iteration

If you're looking for someone who thinks deeply about code, values craftsmanship, and expresses themselves through their work—you're in the right place.

## Definition of Done

**Primary Goal**: Visitors can genuinely get to know me—my skills, experience, personality, and approach to work.

- ✅ Visitors can **get to know me** through an interactive, engaging experience
- ✅ **AI chat feature** allows natural conversation about my background, projects, and interests
- ✅ Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- ✅ Fast, accessible, and intuitive—no barriers to learning about me
- ✅ Optional: PDF resume download available for practical use cases
- 🤔 **Exploring**: Voice cloning feature—visitors can actually talk to an AI version of me (voice-to-voice conversation)

## Let's Connect

If this approach resonates with you and you'd like to discuss opportunities, I'd love to hear from you. The best way to get to know me is through the code I write.

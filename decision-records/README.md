# Decision Records

This directory contains decision records that document significant choices made during the development of this project.

## What are Decision Records?

Decision records capture the _why_ behind important decisions—not just what was chosen, but the context, alternatives considered, and reasoning. They provide transparency into the thought process and help explain the project's evolution.

## Reading the Records

Records are numbered sequentially (e.g., `1-use-decision-records.md`) and follow a consistent format:

- **Status**: Current state of the decision
- **Context**: What situation led to this decision
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was selected
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Consequences**: Implications and trade-offs

## Creating New Records

When making a significant decision, create a new record using the [template](./_template.md). This could include:

- Technology or framework choices
- Architectural patterns
- Design decisions
- Tool selections
- Process decisions

Not every small choice needs a record—focus on decisions that meaningfully impact the project's direction or structure.
